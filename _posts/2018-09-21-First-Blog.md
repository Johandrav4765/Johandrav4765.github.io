So far this course has been very well. I expect the course to be very meaningful and educational, hopefully the things I learn this year would benefit me laterin life. I also expect it to be very fun and creative. What I learned so far is that a the web is a system of interlinked documents accessed via the internet. Which is like woah! The web has all sorts of files, yet the ones I've learned so far are CSS and HTML. HTML is the structure and content of a page while CSS describes the style or color background of a page.
HTML is considered a Markup Language, which describes the content and structure of a document. The last thing I learned was to create a webpage, it was kinda tough but I pulled through and made this exact page! My biggest challenge so far is grasping code, I usually struggle with memorization. I need things to be broken down or taught to me.
