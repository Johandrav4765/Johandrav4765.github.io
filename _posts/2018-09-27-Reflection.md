This week has been easy so far.I understand the concept my AP CSP teacher has been teaching, I feel confident with using a specfic website, he wants us to use. What I've learned so far is to use contracts and examples when solving a problem. In class my classmates and I have used two examples to demonstrate our learning. One which was a game of battleship, we were in pairs trying to guess the coordinates the opposing team had. While doing this we were more aware and familiar to coordinates in a quadrant. This would later on benefit us while coding. The other example involved a flip book, I had to make a animation on a post-it and turn it into a program. The whole flip book activity actually lead towards a language called Pyret; Pyret is a new coding language that involves pyton. The language is an experimental language that Brown University has created, it's considerd a research PL (programming language). I went on the computer and recreated my animation, it was very easy due to past experiences I have with the language. It reminded me of the code I did on DR.Racket, the website containe REPL which was identical to the previous website I used. I usally struggle on small things, such as the spelling or capitzation of a specfic word. That usually misses up the code due to how accurate the program wants the wording to be. Yet I usually find those mistakes and fix them.
