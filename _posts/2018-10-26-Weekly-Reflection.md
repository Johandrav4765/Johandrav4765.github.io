<p> This week started out with the class getting introduced into data science, luckly the program called pyret is apart of data science. As an opening lecture we were introduced to one type of data that we as humans use on a daily basis, a data table. There are two types of data table <i>Categorical</i>: which groups things into category, and <i>Quantitative</i>: it's able to answer the question <i>how many?</i> I learned that datatables have columns and rows, each table has attributes that keep the table organized and readable. Few moments later I learned that numbers can behave like categories and names can act like quantities, which really blew my <i>MIND!</i> Later on I was sent to go on pyret and use a file that contained an example of a table. It was really fun using it, it reminded me of an algebra lesson I learned in the 8th grade. It was where i tried to find the functions that make  the table true.</p>

<p> On wednesday I learned about <i>methods</i> which is able to exist when it's attached to something.I worked with my partner and reviewed a worksheet, it's called BookStrap:Data Science Workbook. We used pyret in order to answer those questions, we were supposed to use method to access information. The day after I went on pyret ansd used previous lesson as a guide for class. I was expected to make bar/pie-chart using name, two strings, it connects to the lesson where I used <i> BC = circle( , , )</i> 
Lastly, we explained connections between computing concepts in context. Our objective was to go on github and tell a story of our learning ny connecting concepts from across the semester using course vocabulary.
