The class and I had a two week period analyzing <i> data tables </i> & <i> data abstractions </i>. A data table contains a data structure which is used to organize many types of information. It would usually be in categorical or numerical order. A data abstraction is a reduced part of a specific part of data which is simplified to represent the whole entire concept. These two go hand and hand whe it comes to sorting and looking for nformation in a data table. Forinstance, I have a data table which has the names, species, gender and many more characteristics of an animal. All of the columns contain a spefic type of data, either a string, boolean, or a number.I want to find out how many animals are female? I could create a function that makes the program able to compute that specific gender in the data table. In a way that's an abstraction because I am taking out small part of a table to get the end result. Later on I am able find that a numerous amount of animals are female.
