<p>We started the week off with <i> Intro To Function Definitions</i>,the lesson started off with a warm-up, I had to copy and compare two expressions. Both expressions had the difference in outcomes and numbers, yet they shared a similarity with structure and order. The whole purpose of the lesson was to develop an abstarction to solve a problem, while the objective was to follow a design recipe to define simple functions. We also learned the difference between a <i>contract</i> and <i>defination</i>. Contracts are what happens in a function, whie definations are the how of the function. we went on pyret to answer 14 questions.</p>

 <i>Contract</i> : ``` fun f(x): 3 * (x + 10) end```
  
  <i> Defination</i> :```triple :: (x :: Number) -> Number```

<p> One of the mastery's was to crate a contcat for a function to solve a problem, while the objective of the day was to connect test cases in a contract. I did a do-now that contained a table and the task was to place data into the rows they belong in. The columns were <i>number</i>,<i>string</i>, <i>image</i> and <i> Boolean</i>. The teacher lectured my class on how contacts and test cases are different after he went over a do-now that we had to do. The do-now was to put contracts and their corresponding test cases together. You may wonder, <i>What is the difference between a test case and a contract?</i> A contract has data values inside a function and a test case is basically testing the contract/function, to see if it's true.</p>

<p> On thursday we learned about a function called a <i>Hypotenuse</i>: consumes two legs of a right triangle and produces the length of the hypotenuse. The mastery was to create a contrat for a function to solve a problem, and the objective was to contract test cases to contracts. The class went on pyret to apply test cases to the 14 questions we started on monday. On friday, I reflected on my learning using a web artifact aka My website. The class and I went on github to reflect on our weeks learning experiences. </p>
