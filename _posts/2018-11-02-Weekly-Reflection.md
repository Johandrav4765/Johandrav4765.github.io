<p>We started the week off with <i> Intro To Function Definitions</i>,the lesson started off with a warm-up, I had to copy and compare two expressions. Both expressions had the difference in outcomes and numbers, yet they shared a similarity with structure and order. The whole purpose of the lesson was to develop an abstarction to solve a problem, while the objective was to follow a design recipe to define simple functions. We also learned the difference between a <i>contract</i> and <i>defination</i>.
  ``` fun f(x): 3 * (x + 10) end```
