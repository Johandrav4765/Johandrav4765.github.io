Previously last period, we had a class discussion; the class discussion consisted of what improvements the class needs to make to be successful. Many of my classmates stated that the class needs spare time, creativity, structure and many more wonderful tips.I know Computer Science is extremely hard to teach.It's great how you as a teacher is reaching out to the students, just to make both teaching and learning less difficult than it already is. I have many suggestions, the one I got is to start preparing us for that end of the year assessment. The majority doesn't grasp what's going to be on the test.It is possible an early test prep could be possible? Another tip I have is to go slow, usually, you speed through the lessons.

I understand you desire us to get as much computer time as possible but we don't possess any idea what's going on. How about sitting down and essentially talk more into depth on the present project we are learning. We tend to jump from one topic to another which is very confusing, must of us don't know the vocabulary.Also more group work, it would be spectacular to do group projects which allows us to interact with an issue and get multiple viewpoints on it. It'll allow us the students to learn how to utilize social skills that will be needed later on in life. Make the lessons more interesting, spice it up...maybe include things we students like and interesting videos? Optimistically, my tips helped in some way or another. Wish you luck!
