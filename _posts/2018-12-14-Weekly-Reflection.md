<b> FLAG PROJECT v2 </b>

For multiple class periods I have been working on designing a flag, I ended up creating to replicate of the Sweden flag. I started off developing the base of the flag. I considered numerous lengths and widths which was desperately hard to manage, so I ended up (160,100).Which provided me spare room for making more flags and it would be easier to make the other shapes.I subsequently produced the golden cross; I made two separate codes for both the vertical and horizontal lines. As I mentioned before the calculation was the troubling part.I subsequently developed the golden cross; I made two separate codes for both the vertical and horizontal lines.With that I was able to create one image. Lastly, I managed the current image and fused it with the finished part that was missing. And with that I was capable to create the finished image.

<i> Program Code: </i>

```
#Sweden Flag

#Simple Parts 
RR = rectangle(160,100,"solid","royal-blue")
YL = rectangle(20,100,"solid","gold")
bb = rectangle(160,20,"solid","gold")

#Combination of Simple Parts 
chicken-nuggets =  place-image(YL, 60, 50, RR)

#Final Combination 
oof =  place-image(bb,80, 50, chicken-nuggets)

```
