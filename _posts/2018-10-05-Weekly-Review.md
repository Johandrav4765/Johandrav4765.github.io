<p>This week's class was fine, I took lots of notes which is something that I love. The environment the class has was all right, sure there were some challenging things, yet I faced through them with my classmates. Currently, I am learned about making connections between representations of computing concepts, HTML requires a specific type of structure which the computer shows as a result. 
</p>

<p>I went to a website and searched up the definition of tags I was able to pair with a classmate and inform them about it. I also learned that there's a website dedicated flags, it's specially made for vexillologist(Flag nerd XD), With the use of that website I got to learn more on a specific flag aka the Japanese flag. It taught me the history, that its 2:3 and the symbolism behind it. I had to research about flags since I'm doing a project on Pyret, the project consist of writing functions that allow me to create the flag. 
</p>

<p>Pyret has an Image library that has first-class data. The primitive stores shape the coder could easily use. A challenge I faced was making a rough copy of the flag on paper, for some reason I had difficulty..maybe I'm not so skilled at making flags. But the flag making was fun, I got to do something hand based in the whole class period.
