<p>  This week we still worked with flags, Our goal for monday was to write a program to reproduce a complex output, yet we were supposed to produce a minimal working example of our very own flag programming. We jotted down things from the white board and worked on a warm up, the warmup showed an image of a rectangle having a circle on it's bottom right and an ellipse on it's top left. We were supposed to make or find a function on pyret that lead us to creating that exact image. After a few minutes he got our attention and showed us an easier way to produce images.
