On 11/7/18 the class started on a Do-now, We supposed to imagine that we owned a famous bakery, and <i>How would we represent our famous cakes?</i> We were supposed to represent them with data yet,<i>what types of data could represent the flavor, layers, and is-icecream? Flavor is represented with string, layers with numbers, and is-icecream with Boolean. The mastery of the day was to create abstractions, while the objective was to define a new data type, and being able to define functions that work with that data. Later on I learned that data definations are an <i>abstraction</i> of data tables, functions are <i>abstraction</i> of an expression. The teacher told us the reason why a data function is an abstraction of a table, it's because it is able to generalize data. Another thinng we learned was to an dot excessor,later on we went on pyret and worked on functions.
 

<i>data definitions</i>   data MyCake:
                              cake(flavor:: string,
                                   layers:: number,
                                   is-icecream:: Boolean)
                           end     
                        
 
<i> dot excessor</i> 
                    ```
                       pb-cake = cake("Peanutbutter",3,false
                       pb-cake.flavor
                       pb-cake.is-icecream
                       pb-cake.layors
                       
                     ```
