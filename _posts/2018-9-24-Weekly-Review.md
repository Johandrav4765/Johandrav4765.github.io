Previously I learned to identify change in a simple video game. The class was very animated about the lesson we were doing that day. Everyone in the class seems to be very interested in the subject, which was very impactful. Sure some of the students fooled around but it didn't effect our learning. A learning skill I want to work on is memoriztion, it tends to get in the way of my learning. Another is to look at my work carefully, due to a habit I have I work very fast. My goal is to leave Ap Computer Science with knowledge that I'd be able to use later on in my life. Another is to atleast pass the AP test, I know I can make my mom proud by doing that. I mentiioned the struggles and the way I'm coping with them is by reading carefully and to ask others for help. It was very useful.
