<p>  This week we still worked with flags, our goal for monday was to write a program to reproduce a complex output, yet we were supposed to produce a minimal working example of our very own flag programming. We jotted down things from the white board and worked on a warm up, the warmup showed an image of a rectangle having a circle on it's bottom right and an ellipse on it's top left. We were supposed to make or find a function on pyret that lead us to creating that exact image. After a few minutes he got our attention and showed us an easier way to produce images. It involved three steps, simple parts,combinations of simple parts and final combination. They are used to make a complex function simple. The next day we applied the same exact format to create our every own flags, the flags we have been planning to do for the last few days.

<p> It was a challenge for me when I started out. I tried to follow the structure on making the functions which got me all caught up. On of my classmates saw my distress and helped me out. I then started to understand how to create the image. The image I was trying to make was the japanese flag. I used simple shapes such as a circle and a rectangle. It was a lot of work on getting the correct measurements on pyret. I'm still trying to make another flag even if I still fail at it. I'll return to it one day and know how to create it. I also had issues with using Markdown syntax, it was difficult ut with theuse of the internet, I got some of them down.

<h1> LINE OF CODE </h1>
<p>
  <i> #Simple Parts
BC = circle((200 * 3/5) / 2,"solid","red")
RR = rectangle(300,200,"solid","white")

#Combination Of Simple Parts 

BC-RR = place-image(BC,100,100,RR)

#Final Combination
place-image(BC,300/2,200/2,RR)  </i>
