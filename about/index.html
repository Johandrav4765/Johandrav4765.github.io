My name is Johandra Vargas and I'm 15 years old. I attend AFSE which stands for Academy For Software Engineering. I am currently as Sophomore, it's pretty great. I have a love towards anime and dealing with computers. I'm not so great at computers but it's fun when I try. I have a hobby and love for drawing. As time goes on I'll find more passions that'll be filled in this site.Thanks for reading!
