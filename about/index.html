<h1> Heyo! I am the owner of this site!  </h1>

<p> I'm a sophomore in AFSE, I am a totally anime nerd who loves to cuddle! Other than that I love learning about how things work and the concepts behind things. On this iste I'll demonstrate my weekly learning about APCPS, a subject that I am interested in. I may not be the best but I'll persevere through the challenges. Thanks for reading!!(`•ω•´๑)</p>
